      <h2>Integerty - Simplicity - Privacy</h2>
      <p>This is what Bubb is made for.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <div>
        <p>
          Your conversations (or bubbles) are contained on your device only*,
          effectively keeping it P2P.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      <div>
        <p>
          - Create new accounts at any time, and delete accounts at any time.
          <br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          - Bubb uses a unique, passwordless system where an account is as easy
          as entering a Username. <br />
        </p>
      </div>
      - Bubbles are unique, and can be transferred using a transfer key.
      <br />
      <div>
        <p>
          - People can join and leave bubbles as they please, but new people
          won't see history without a transfer key.
        </p>
